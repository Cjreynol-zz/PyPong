Version 1.5

start/stop ball		V/B		V/B

Version 1.5 is a step back in functionality of the game, but a step forward in design.  It is now implemented as a group of classes working together, versus a single large procedurally coded filed.  See pypongv1.py for the first version.

Currently the game only has basic movement and collision detection of the paddles and ball.  No scoring or tallying of score.  Sound effects have also not yet been implemented in this new version.
